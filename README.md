# My Portfolio

Hello! I’m Eduardo Quiroz, a physics student at "Universidad Mayor de San Simón" from Cochabamba, Bolivia. Here are some of the projects I've worked on during my studies:

## Projects

### **[Development of a Crossmatch Algorithm for Star and Radio Source Catalogs](link_to_project6)**  

- **Objective**:  
  Develop an efficient algorithm to crossmatch star and radio source catalogs by optimizing the angular separation calculation and implementing a binary search approach to enhance performance.

- **Achievements**:  
  Successfully developed an optimized algorithm for fast and accurate crossmatching between star catalogs and radio source databases, significantly improving the efficiency of the matching process. Additionally, the process was parallelized to utilize multiple processors, further enhancing performance and reducing computation time.

- **Tools Used**:  
  Python, NumPy, multiprocessing package, custom binary search implementation.

### **[Search for Radio Stars Using the "Image Method" by Adjusting Star Positions to Observation Epochs](link_to_project8)**    

- **Objective**:  
  Develop a method for identifying radio-emitting stars by adjusting star positions to the precise observation epochs. This method, called the **"Método de Imágenes"**, generates observational data for each star based on its position at a given epoch, without relying on an existing catalog of radio sources.

- **Achievements**:  
  Created the **"Image Method"**, which simulates star observations by adjusting their positions to the exact observation epochs. This method allows the identification of radio-emitting stars without the need for a pre-existing radio source catalog, significantly broadening the scope of the search.

- **Tools Used**:  
  Python, Astropy, Web scraping techniques for gathering observational data.

### **[False Positive Estimation for Crossmatch Between Catalogs](link_to_project7)**  

- **Objective**:  
  Estimate the likelihood of false positives in the crossmatching process by simulating random star positions within irregular observation areas.

- **Achievements**:  
  Performed simulations using random positions of stars to generate over 1.5 million observations and estimate the probability of false positives for our crossmatch algorithm.

- **Tools Used**:  
  Python, NumPy, Web scraping for data collection, statistical analysis.

### **[Simulation of False Positives for Image-Based Method](link_to_project9)**  

- **Objective**:  
  Simulate false positives in image-based observations to refine our methodology for identifying radio-emitting stars using randomized star positions within observation areas.

- **Achievements**:  
  Improved the false positive estimation method by generating simulated observations and identifying potential false positives, contributing to a more reliable detection method.

- **Objective**:  
  Generate images of radio observations showing star positions and their trajectories, in order to analyze proper motions visible in radio frequency observations.

- **Achievements**:  
  Created radio observation images using Python’s Kapteyn package, which enabled the visualization of proper motions for stars and radio sources, providing valuable insights into their movement across the sky.

- **Objective**:  
  Analyze the temporal variability of radio sources using a custom variability index (IVT) to distinguish between radio stars and extragalactic radio sources.

- **Achievements**:  
  Developed the IVT index, which successfully identified a significant difference in variability between radio stars and extragalactic sources. This led to the confirmation of two new radio stars based on variability characteristics.

- **Achievements**:  
  Successfully used GEANT4 to simulate electron irradiation and observed the X-ray spectrum. Results were analyzed using ROOT, providing insights into X-ray production in a tungsten sample.
