# My Portfolio

Hello! I’m Eduardo Quiroz, a physics student at "Universidad Mayor de San Simón" from Cochabamba, Bolivia. Here are some of the projects I've worked on during my studies:

## Projects

- **[Analysis of Data from Gaia Test Irradiation on CCDs](link_to_project1)**: This project involved astrometric and photometric analysis of the CCN10 test data provided by the ESA. It was part of the preparations for the Gaia mission, which aims to explore the stellar population of our galaxy.
  
- **[X-Ray Generation Simulation from Electron Irradiation on Tungsten](link_to_project2)**: A simulation using GEANT4, a CERN-based toolkit, to study the characteristic X-ray spectrum produced by electron irradiation on a tungsten sample. The results were analyzed using ROOT.

- **[Climate Simulation Model with RegCM](link_to_project3)**: I used RegCM to simulate climate patterns for Bolivia, with a focus on high-resolution downscaling for the Cochabamba region. This project involved extensive automation for plotting and analyzing simulation results.

- **[Study of Clusters in Cochabamba's Night Sky](link_to_project4)**: A study of open and globular clusters visible from Cochabamba, using Gaia DR3 and 2MASS data. This project aimed to provide valuable information for amateur astronomers.

- **[Particle Detection Data Analysis at UMSA (Cota Cota, La Paz)](link_to_project5)**: This project involved the analysis of particle detection data from scintillators and Cherenkov detectors. I developed an algorithm to structure the data for analysis and used the Skewed Voigt model for peak fitting.

- **[Development of an Algorithm for Cross-Matching Star and Radio Source Catalogs](link_to_project6)**: I developed an efficient algorithm to cross-match star catalogs with radio source catalogs, optimizing angular separation calculations and using binary search for faster matching.

- **[Estimation of False Positives for Crossmatch between Catalogs](link_to_project7)**: This project involved simulating random star positions to estimate false positives in the catalog cross-matching process. The simulation was used to refine matching criteria.

- **[Search for Radio-Emitting Stars with Position Adjustments to Observation Epochs](link_to_project8)**: A method for identifying stars emitting in radio frequencies, adjusting their positions to precise observation epochs without relying on a radio source catalog.

- **[Simulation of False Positives for Image-Based Method](link_to_project9)**: This project involved simulating false positives in radio images by randomizing star positions within an irregular observation area and analyzing the results.

- **[Generation of Radio Observation Images](link_to_project10)**: Using Python and the Kapteyn package, I generated images of radio observations, including star positions and trajectories, to observe proper motion in radio-emitting stars.

- **[Temporal Variability Analysis (IVT) in Radio Sources](link_to_project11)**: I developed a custom parameter (IVT) to analyze temporal variability in radio sources, identifying new radio-emitting stars and differentiating them from extragalactic objects.
